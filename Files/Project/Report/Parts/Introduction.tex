\section{Introducton}
\label{Intro}
This report is the result of a project in Data Mining at the IT-University of Copenhagen during spring 2013.
\\Source code, data sets and graphs can be found in our GIT repository \textbf{https://github.com/esfdk/mdmi}\footnote{See Files/Project for the downloaded datasets and src/project for project code.}. 

\section{Goal of the project}
This project attempts to cluster European nations based on population, balance of payments\footnote{Balance of Payments is the method countries use to monitor assets and liabilities.}, unemployment rate and gross domestic product from 1975 to 2012.

\subsection{Methods}
We use Weka to process our data. Clustering is done using Weka's simple k-means algorithm and frequent patterns are found using Weka's A-Priori algorithm.
\\We preprocess the data using our self-written algorithms.

\subsection{Questions}
\label{Intro_que}
\begin{my_itemize}
\item What, if any, European nations stay in the same cluster from 1983 to 2012?
\item What, if any, European nations change cluster often from 1983 to 2012?
\item What cluster does the United States of America (2011) fit into and what countries are in that same cluster for 2011?
\item What, if any, frequent patterns are in the data?
\end{my_itemize}
