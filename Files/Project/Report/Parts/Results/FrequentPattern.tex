\subsection{Frequent Patterns}
\label{Res_FP}
We ran Weka's Apriori algorithm with the standard input values at first with a minimum support of 0.1 (10\% of the total data entries). This resulted in no frequent 4-itemsets (and no association rules). In addition we ran the algorithm with a minimum support value of 0.05 (5\%). This also resuletd in no frequent 4-itemsets (and no association rules).
\\The first time a frequent 4-itemset was found was when we lowered the minimum support value to 0.01 (1\%). The 4-itemset had a support count of 9 and had values:
\begin{align*}
	[unemploymentRate="2.0-2.5"; \\
	balanceOfPayments="1.0-1.5"; \\
	gdpPerInhabitant="0.0-0.5"; \\
	population="0.0-0.5"]
\end{align*}

Weka generated an association rule with 90\% confidence based on the itemset. 
\\There are 10 occurences of the following itemset in the dataset:
\begin{align*}
	[unemploymentRate="2.0-2.5";\\
	balanceOfPayments="1.0-1.5";\\ 
	population="0.0-0.5"]
\end{align*}

There were 9 instances where \begin{math}[gdpPerInhabitant=0.0-0.5]\end{math} was combined with the beforementioned itemset.

The association rule generated from these instances is as follows:
\begin{align*}
	[unemploymentRate="2.0-2.5";\\
	balanceOfPayments="1.0-1.5";\\ 
	population="0.0-0.5"]
	\\==> gdpPerInhabitant="0.0-0.5"
\end{align*}
