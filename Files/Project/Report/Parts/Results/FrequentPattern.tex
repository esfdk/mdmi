\subsection{Frequent Patterns}
\label{Res_FP}

We decided to run the A Priori with a support of 10\%, 5\% and 1\% (the results for the runs can be seen in appendix \ref{A_ap_results} on page \pageref{A_ap_results}). We found that there were no frequent patterns of size four for neither 10\% nor 5\%. We had to lower the support to 1\% before we found the size four itemset \texttt{[unemploymentRate=2.0-2.5 balanceOfPayments=1.0-1.5 gdpPerInhabitant=0.0-0.5 population=0.0-0.5 9]} with the following rule

\begin{center}
	\texttt{unemploymentRate=2.0-2.5 balanceOfPayments=1.0-1.5 population=0.0-0.5 10 ==> gdpPerInhabitant=0.0-0.5 9}
\end{center}

with a confidence of 90\%.
