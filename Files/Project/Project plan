Project plan:

	*Data sets:
		- Uemployment rates in different countries for the past thirty years (Eurostat)
		- Average income per capita
		- Market balance

	* Questions:
		- Yearly (monthly?) clusters for uemployment rates/countries 
			-- Are northern european countries better at handling periods of high unemployment than southern european countries?
			-- Periods of high uemployment in clusters 
		- Is there a correlation between the level of income of the uemployed in different clusters?
		- Is it possible to predict marketbalance changes and/or unemployment rates from the other?
			-- Is there a correlation between uemployment clusters and market balance change impact?
		- Do the different periods of big uemployment rate changes impact different parts of the world differently?

	* Methods (algorithms):
		- Clustering
			-- K-means
		- 
			--

	* Programs:
		- Self-coded
		- Weka?
